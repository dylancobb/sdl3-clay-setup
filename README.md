# Fun with SDL3 and Clay

This repo follows my blog posts ([part 1](https://dylancobb.dev/blog/clay-sdl-setup-1/), [part 2](https://dylancobb.dev/blog/clay-sdl-setup-2/) about setting up SDL3 and Clay, rendering some basic UI, and building to both a desktop application and WebAssembly with CMake.

Part 3 TODO:

- [x] Extract colours to state
- [x] Build a busier layout
- [x] Add an interactive element
  - Light / dark mode toggle?
- [x] Clay debug console
- [ ] CMake
